Welcome to TC1D's documentation!
================================

T\ :sub:`c`\ 1D is a one-dimensional thermal and thermochronometer age prediction model that can simulate the effects of various geodynamic and geomorphic processes on thermochronometer ages.
It currently supports prediction of apatite and zircon (U-Th)/He and fission-track ages.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.
