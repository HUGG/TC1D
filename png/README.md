# Output plots

This directory will be used as a default location for plots saved in Tc1D.
The outplot plots that are normally created include the following:

- `T_rho_hist.png` - Model geotherms through time (left) and corresponding rock densities (right)
- `elev_hist.png` - Predicted surface elevation changes due to thermal isostasy (top) and surface erosion rate prescribed in the model (bottom)
- `cooling_hist.png` - Predicted thermal history with predicted (and possibly observed) thermochronometer ages (top), surface erosion rate prescribed in the model (bottom left), and predicted apatite fission track length distribution (bottom right)
- `past_ages.png` - Predicted thermochronometer ages through time at the time of exposure at the surface (top) or compensating for the time since being exposed at the surface (bottom)
